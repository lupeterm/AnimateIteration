# AnimateIteration
---
Little side project to animate different strategies of iterating over openfoam meshes during matrix assembly.

Usually these meshes are 3d, which makes it hard to visualize. Therefore, the cells and faces are hardcoded for now. 

The plan would be to eventually visualize iteration based on actual OpenFOAM cases in 3D.

## Showcase: Cell-Based Iteration
